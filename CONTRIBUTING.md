## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an 18F open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository]( https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).

## How to contribute

### Issues

If there’s anything you’d like to understand about 18F's visual design, brand, or assets, submit an issue about it. If you see something that should be fixed but don’t want to do so yourself, submit an issue. If you have an idea for an improvement... well, you get the idea.

### What to include in an issue

Not all of these will apply to all issues. But when they do, it’s very helpful to see them (special thanks to @ondrae for [the suggestion of this list](https://github.com/18F/open-source-guide/issues/15#issuecomment-129552978)).

- **Description:** okay, this one does apply to all issues. :) 
- **How to reproduce:** if your issue is a bug, any information about how we can see it ourselves
- **Screenshots:** similarly, so we can see what you’re seeing
- **Files:** anything with helpful information about the issue
- **To dos:** if your issue is an enhancement, a list of improvements or steps to help us meet the goal of the enhancement

If your issue is a request for a new teamplate or asset, tell us about what you need, and how it would be useful to you.

### Where to submit a pull request

Submit pull requests to the `18f-pages-staging` branch. This is the main branch. If you’re not sure how to submit a pull request, feel free to submit an issue and we will try to address it ourselves.

### What to include in a pull request

Including these will help us be faster and better at responding.

- **Changes:** a list, preferably bulleted, of what you’re changing
- **Notes:** anything that might help us understand the change, like why you’re doing it or alternative approaches you tried
- **Screenshots:** if your pull request will affect layout or interaction, to show us what you’re fixing or changing
