# 18F Brand
This is the home of 18F's evolving brand assets and style guide. It's a work in progress, as we're releasing new assets incrementally. Come visit us in #18f-branding on slack for help with implementing these assets, questions, or to philosophize on the meaning of type. 

## Assets available now:
- Logo files
- Favicon files
- Color palette and preliminary 5text/background color guidance to conform with 508 standards.
- 18F Nimbus font files
- Keynote template and example presentation
- Desktop art

## Coming soon:
- More templates (Google slides, Good docs, & many more)
- Better guidance on how to use colors, fonts, logos, and other design assets
- and more! We're adapting to our team's needs as we go, so if there's something you'd like to see us build or offer guidance on, file an issue in this repository.
