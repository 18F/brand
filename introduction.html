<h2 class="styleguide-header">Introducing 18F’s brand toolkit</h2>

<p>18F’s brand toolkit is a flexible, easy-to-use system that helps you communicate clearly while building visual consistency across our team’s work. It features a growing set of templates and guides you can use to meet common design needs — and save time!</p>

<p>Our ability to communicate our goals and deliver high-quality products and services is inseparable from our visual identity. We recognize that having a strong brand is just as important for government agencies as it is for private companies — our users expect nothing less.</p> 

<p>Because a brand communicates our core values, it helps us build trust with our users, increase engagement, foster public input and open-source contributions, and improve the public’s perception of government, all of which are central to our mission.</p>
