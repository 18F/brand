<h2 class="styleguide-header">Introducing 18F’s brand toolkit</h2>

<p>18F’s brand toolkit is a flexible, easy-to-use system that helps you communicate clearly while building visual consistency across our team’s work. It features a growing set of templates and guides you can use to meet common design needs — and save time!</p>

<p>Our ability to communicate our goals and deliver high-quality products and services is inseparable from our visual identity. We recognize that having a strong brand is just as important for government agencies as it is for private companies — our users expect nothing less.</p> 

<p>Because a brand communicates our core values, it helps us build trust with our users, increase engagement, foster public input and open-source contributions, and improve the public’s perception of government, all of which are central to our mission.</p>

<h2 class="styleguide-header">The benefits of a brand toolkit</h2>

<p>You may be an ace at designing presentation decks (and if that’s the case, we salute you!).</p> 

<p>Even so, using 18F’s brand toolkit offers some distinct advantages, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>More effective communication: </strong>Our materials are designed to capture your user’s attention and direct it to the most relevant content. The result? More effective communication, more quickly.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Saved design time: </strong>Use our templates to create stunning presentations, one sheets, and more, without starting from scratch.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Ease of use: </strong>You don’t need a design background to use our templates and guides: Everything is self-explanatory. Ping us in #18f-branding for tips on using existing resources and for more in-depth branding advice. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Increased visual consistency: </strong>Our visual identity is professional, bold, and optimistic — values that are conveyed by each element of the toolkit.  
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Promotion of good design: </strong>By using our materials (which are crisp, consistent, and reflective of user need) you’re implicitly promoting good design — in other words, practicing what 18F preaches.
