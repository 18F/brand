<p>18F uses a customized version of <a href="https://feathericons.com/">Feather Icons</a> for its iconography. Feather Icons is <a href="https://github.com/feathericons/feather/blob/master/LICENSE">licensed under an MIT License</a>, with copyright belonging to Cole Bemis.</p>

<h2>Design Specs</h2>
<p>Most of the icons retain the base styling of Feather icons. The 18F version includes a few adjustments.</p>
<li>Icons are drawn on a 48x48 grid, with some custom detailed icons drawn on a 64x64 grid</li>
<li>Strokes of 2px, centered, with capped ends.</li>
<li>For square icons, a min width or height of 28px.</li>
<li>For circular icons, a min width or height of 34px.</li>
<li>Minimum of 2px between elements.</li>

<h2>Get the icons</h2>
<p>You can access a set of common icons in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/templates/">18F Google Slides template</a> (only available to GSA staff), or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dist/18F_feather.zip">download the full set.</a></p>

<p>The download includes:</p>

<h2>Representing humans</h2>
<p>In order to offer more diverse and expressive ways to represent humans, we created a custom set of 18F Avataaars (based on <a href="https://getavataaars.com/">the work of Pablo Stanley</a>). These are great stand-ins for showing emotion and to represent anonymous user groups. We've started with 10 characters and a range of emotions.
We have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CXXvxBbVjO3LjIUwRYEbk8WHpsG0AJdUc6SI_jAZDNQ/edit#slide=id.g5fdac3c814_0_209">starter deck</a>, which includes guidance on different ways to represent humans, as well as a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MFGWlJ6Z1ZzIVXK0h0Xh8RsUiBZzYdbg">full sketch library< for designers (only available to GSA staff).</p>
