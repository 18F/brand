title: Visual design principles
---

<p>The purpose of visual design principles is to provide guidance for applying and extending the 18F identity into other communication assets. They serve as a framework for evaluating potential design solutions against our core values and priorities.</p>
<p>18F's visual design principles are intended to be applied to projects that should reflect the 18F brand, not work we do for our partners.</p>

<h2>Lead by example</h2>
<p>You’re a role model. Don’t do anything you wouldn’t encourage others to copy.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is this design an example of best practices? If not, is it a modification you believe others should consider a best practice?</li>
	<li>How would you feel if this design was repeated across 18F or government?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lead by example</h2>
<p>Bring clarity to content through design choices that support meaning and intent. Design a fair, inclusive, and open platform for the many voices that make up 18F.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do the visuals overpower the content?</li>
	<li>Do the design choices promote clarity of meaning?</li>
	<li>What message does the design convey before you read the words?</li>
	<li>How does typographic hierarchy contribute to understanding?</li>
	<li>Does the content design allow for multiple levels of engagement?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Start with the expected</h2>
<p>Meet expectations before you raise them. Favor solutions from standards. Use common design patterns that establish confidence and trust. Don’t reinvent the wheel, incrementally improve it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are you using a commonly used pattern?</li>
	<li>Has someone else solved this problem already?</li>
	<li>What is the potential benefit of an unconventional solution?</li>
	<li>Could your modifications be applied back to a standard?</li>
	<li>Are the unique elements of the design necessary? Could an existing element be used instead?</li>
	<li>Is the reason for design choices apparent?</li>
	<li>Does your design feel part of a considered visual system?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Convince with soundness not loudness</h2>
<p>Design with confidence and calmness by being honest and direct. Practice visual design with solid fundamentals, attention to detail, flexibility, and resilience.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is the layout of elements intuitive?</li>
	<li>Does the design guide the viewer?</li>
	<li>Are you leveraging typographic styles?</li>
	<li>Are there elements that get in the way of understanding?</li>
	<li>Have you run spell check lately?</li>
	<li>Is the tone honest, respectful, and inviting?</li>
	<li>Does it exceed expectations for government?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keep questioning</h2>
<p>Have opinions, express them, and be open to change. Question the principles — acknowledge their dynamic, iterative nature. Evolve alongside 18F’s people, culture, and core values. Push forward.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is something missing? Is this an opportunity for the principles to grow?</li>
	<li>Are these principles consistent with 18F’s organizational principles?</li>
	<li>Do the decisions encouraged by these principles result in the desired outcomes for the folks using what we design?</li>
	<li>Have you discussed any dissatisfaction with the principles with anyone? Why not?</li>
</ul>
