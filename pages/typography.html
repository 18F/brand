<p>The primary font is <strong>Helvetica Neue</strong>, in bold and regular weights.</p>

<p>We use one typeface to keep things simple, and use variations in size and weight to create hierarchy.</p> 

<p>Helvetica Neue is a system font on all Apple devices, so you don't need to download or install anything. On Windows devices, if Helvetica Neue is not available, use Arial as a replacement.</p>
