<p>The primary font is <strong>Helvetica Neue</strong>, in bold and regular weights.</p>

<p>We use one typeface to keep things simple, and use variations in size and weight to create hierarchy.</p> 

<p>Helvetica Neue is a system font on all Apple devices, so you don't need to download or install anything. On Windows devices, if Helvetica Neue is not available, use Arial as a replacement.</p>

  <div class="usa-width-one-half">
    <p>Merriweather is an open-source serif typeface designed for on-screen reading. This font is ideal for text-dense design: the letterforms have a tall x-height but remain relatively small, making for excellent readability across screen sizes while not occupying extra horizontal space.</p>
    <p>The combination of slim and thick weights gives the font family stylistic range, while conveying a desirable mix of classic, yet modern simplicity. Merriweather communicates warmth and credibility at both large and smaller font sizes.</p>
